# ABOUT POOTSY

Pootsy is a start-up founded in 2016 by 3 long-time colleagues and friends who used to work in a digital agency. As an early stage startup, we are supported by W.I.N.G. funds and a private investor.

Pootsy is a booking platform for home services, specialised in cleaning services. Local businesses can manage their cleaners’ plannings while customers can easily find an available cleaner to suit their needs.

Pootsy want to revolutionise the digital experience of professional home services for the Customers, but also for the Workers and local businesses.

Don’t forget to have a look at our Customers App, available on iOS and Android: http://onelink.to/pootsy

# THE TECHNICAL STACK

Pootsy is a web platform built with love and Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL for the back-end and ReactJS + redux for the front-end.

The mobile apps are written in Java for Android and Swift for iOS while another app is in ReactNative.

Tests and continuous integration really mean a lot for us and we try to develop fast with the confidence that the product does not break on every single commit.

# RAILS DEVELOPER AT POOTSY

As a back-end developer at Pootsy, you’ll be expected to have a deep impact on whole platform, serving API to all of our client-facing applications. You will be part of the same adventure as anyone else in the startup and your insights will be listened to.

We’re looking for someone who :

Bonus point if you know any other tech from our current stack (Java, Swift, ReactJS) or are willing to learn any of those technologies.

Some great and exciting challenges are around the corner for Pootsy: complex algorithms, machine learning, big data, micro-services,… We are looking for someone who will drive these challenges and turn them into reality.

# WORKING AT POOTSY

Pootsy’s offices are located in a googlesque location outside of Brussels, at http://buzzynest.com in La Hulpe. It’s also possible to work from Brussels and homeworking is encouraged.

Working at Pootsy typically means that you take part of our discussions about architectures and the future of the product, the – timeboxed ! – scrum meetings and that you love Slack as much as we do (and we really do).

Need more challenge ? You can try to beat us at Ping Pong.

Sounds like fun? Please, contact us (paul@pootsy.be) and let’s grab a beer (our favorite: a Ginette) or a gin !
